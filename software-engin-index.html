          The role that peer assessment and pairing up have in the class demonstrate a focus on collaboration. Peer assessment
          allows us to practice giving feedback to others and seeing different ways of doing the same thing, while pairing up 
          leads directly collaboration.

        <td>
          The class places importance on soft skills in part by the methods of peer assessment and pairing up but additionally
          with the emphasis placed on attendance. Mayuko says that the effective software engineers she has worked with were 
          those who were pleasant people. The reason that complete attendance is important in the class is out of consideration
          for our peers who are paired up with us. In this way we practice the soft skill of being polite and considerate.
        <td>
          The aspect of self-evaluation in the course allows us as students gives us the opportunity to be true to ourselves. 
          In explaining to the professor what grade we think we deserve and why, we first have to understand it ourselves.
